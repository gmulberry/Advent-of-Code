This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code (AoC) (https://github.com/topics/advent-of-code) puzzles.
I started working on AoC in December 2022, but will likely complete puzzles from earlier years over time. 
At this point (2022-12-15) all of my solutions have been completed in MATLAB.
I am trying to solve the puzzles with minimal use of external libraries or MATLAB toolboxes. 
If I do use an external source, I will do my best to cite where I obtained them.
I am including any puzzle input text files as "input.txt".
For some of the days I am also including other input files, usually "input1.txt" or similar that were used in the process of solving the puzzle. 
Sometimes these are examples given by the puzzle itself, or were created by me to help solve the puzzle.
